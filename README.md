# Jigsaw Puzzle Solver with OpenCV
## Overview
Jigsaw Puzzle Solver is project that uses advanced image processing and computer vision techniques to automate the solving of jigsaw puzzles.
This solution is designed to handle puzzles with specific characteristics.
#### Key Constraints and Considerations:
* **Shapes of puzzle pieces:** The algorithm is optimized for pieces that closely resemble a square shape.
* **Size of pieces:** There is a size threshold for the puzzle pieces. The pieces should be above a certain size to be accurately processed by the algorithm.(Sample pictures are in the project_images folder)

This project is part of a bigger [project](https://github.com/HamzaAlmahrous/jigsaw-genius). 

## Features
* Solve jigsaw puzzles automatically.
* The option to solve the puzzle with or wihtout a hint which is the picture assembled.


## Algorithm pipeline



## Setup
To run the Jigsaw Puzzle Solver on your local machine, you'll need to have Python and OpenCV installed. Python is the programming language used, and OpenCV is a critical library for image processing functionalities in the project. After setting up these prerequisites, you can proceed to clone the repository onto your local device. Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and run the application.
